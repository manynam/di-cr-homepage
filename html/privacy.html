            <p>Y Studio operates this website and the DI-CR mobile application.</p>
            <p>The use of our services is possible without any indication of personal data. Preferences and user input made in the apps are, if at all, stored locally on the device and are not transmitted to us.

            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            <p>Like most other Internet pages, we use cookies on our website. Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory. Cookies may contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie in form of a character string. Through this ID websites and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited websites and servers to distinguish the individual browser of the data subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies and thus makes the specific Internet browser identifiable and recognizable.Through the use of cookies, we can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly services that would otherwise not be possible to implement.We may use cookies to optimize the information and offers on our website with the user in mind and to make it easier for users to utilize its content. The user that allows cookies, e.g. does not have to fill in access data each time the website is visited, because the access data is stored in a cookie on the userâ€™s computer system and thus will be filled in automatically. Another common example is a shopping cart in an online shop, which remembers what the costumer placed in it through a cookie.The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our website by making a respective setting in the Internet browser used. In addition, already set cookies may be deleted by the data subject at any time via the Internet browser or other software programs. This functionality is provided by all popular Internet browsers. If the data subject chooses to deactivate cookies, not all functions of our website may be entirely usable.</p>

            <p>If the data subject chooses to contact the controller by e-mail or via a contact form, the voluntarily provided personal data is automatically stored. The personal data transmitted by the data subject will not be transferred to third parties and is only stored for the purpose of contacting or processing the data subject.</p>
            <h3>Legal bases of processing</h3>
            <p>If we obtain consent for the processing of a data subjects personal data, that consent is the legal basis for the processing operations as stated in Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR.
